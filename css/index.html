    <h2> Early life</h2>
    <p> Israel Adesanya is a professional ufc fighter who was born in Nigeria and later moved to NZ when he was 10 years old because his parents wanted him and his four siblings to get better education. 
        Israel Adesanya was born on the 22 of July in 1989 making him 33 years old. He currently competes in the middleweight division in the Ufc where he is the current and two time ufc middleweight champion.</p>

        <h1> Israel Adesanya The Last Stylebender </h1>
        <h2> Rise To Fame</h2>
        <p> In 2017 it was announced that Israel signed a contract with Ufc and then in 2018 he made his debut against Rob Wilkinson. He won that fight by knockout in the second round.
         After many fights he then became Middleweight champion in 2019 who he fought against Kelvin Gastelum by unanimous decision. One of Izzys best fights was when he fought Robert Whittaker who he knocked out in the second round and then after that he fought Yoel Romero and won that by split decision. He was on a winning streak and then he got to fight Paulo Costa who was an undefeated fighter and was talking a lot of trash online saying he was going to KO Izzy and that “He's too skinny”.
         Izzy however proved the critics wrong and even Costa by knocking him out in the second round. 
         He even celebrated by doing an offensive sex celebration and got a lot of slack for it but I loved it because he underestimated Izzy and was making fun of his size. 
         Just because you are bigger doesn't always mean you have the advantage. 
         In 2022 Adesanya sadly lost to Alex Pereira who had two victories against him in kickboxing from previous years. 
         This was his first lost in middleweight but he came back like always the next year for a rematch and knocked Alex out in the second round.</p>
